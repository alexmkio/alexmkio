## Thanks for stopping by
:wave: Hi, I'm Alex!

#### My story 
Introduced to programming when I was 14 years old -- I always thought that a career in tech was likely but had trouble seeing a path through all the noise. I took a circuitous route that led to a life supporting retail stores and clinical laboratories in management roles before finally landing at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/).

Today I look forward to combining the skills I‚Äôve acquired in managing nearly every business I‚Äôve worked for and my newly obtained programming skills. I'm a passionate and energetic software engineer who thrives on problem solving and creating holistic career experiences for those around me.

I encourage you to reach out to me (me@alexkio.com). I look forward to discussing how I can best contribute to your organization. 

#### Work and Activities
- Most of the last decade I served as the Manager of Operations at the University of Florida's [pathology laboratorie's](https://pathology.ufl.edu/) diabetes research division and at a start-up clinical laboratory in the Denver metro area.
- I am an avid [cyclist](https://bikerumor.com/2019/05/28/bikerumor-pic-of-the-day-riffrafting-on-the-santa-fe-river-florida/) and aspirational [frame builder](https://willadean.com/).
- Lover of backpacking and riding bikes up mountains.
